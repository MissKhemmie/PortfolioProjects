#Overview
This portfolio showcases my skills in data exploration, data cleaning, and data visualization using different tools and techniques. The projects in this portfolio include:

#COVID-19 Data Exploration
In this project, I explored the COVID-19 dataset using SQL. I analyzed the data to understand the impact of COVID-19 on different countries, regions, and demographics. I also created visualizations to understand the trends and patterns in the data.

#Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
In this project, I cleaned the Nashville Housing dataset using SQL. The dataset contained missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data. I used SQL queries to clean the dataset and ensure that the data is consistent and accurate.

#Bike Buyer Data Cleaning and Dashboard in Excel
In this project, I worked with a bike buyer dataset in Excel. The dataset contained missing values and inconsistent data. I used various Excel tools and techniques, such as trim,mfiltering and sorting, to clean the data and ensure that it was accurate and consistent.

After cleaning the data, I used pivot tables to analyze and summarize the data and created a dashboard in Excel to visualize the data. The dashboard included charts that provided insights into the bike buyer data. The charts are interactive and allows the user to filter the data based on different criteria.

Overall, this project demonstrates my proficiency in working with Excel and using tools and techniques to clean and analyze data.

#Conclusion
This portfolio showcases my skills in data exploration, data cleaning, and data visualization using different tools and techniques.
