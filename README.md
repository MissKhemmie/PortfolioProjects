#Overview:

This portfolio showcases my skills in data exploration, data cleaning, and data visualization using different tools and techniques. The projects in this portfolio include:

#COVID-19 Data Exploration:

In this project, I explored the COVID-19 dataset using **SQL**. I analyzed the data to understand the impact of COVID-19 on different countries, regions, and demographics. I also created visualizations to understand the trends and patterns in the data.

#Nashville Housing Data Cleaning:

In this project, I cleaned the Nashville Housing dataset using **SQL**. The dataset contained missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data. I used SQL queries to clean the dataset and ensure that the data is consistent and accurate.

#Airbnb Data Visualization:

In this project, I worked with an Airbnb dataset and used **Tableau** to create visualizations. I analyzed the data to gain insights into the Airbnb market, such as popular neighborhoods, pricing trends, and occupancy rates. The visualizations effectively present the findings and provide valuable insights.

#Bike Buyer Data Cleaning and Dashboard in Excel:

In this project, I worked with a bike buyer dataset in **Excel**. The dataset contained missing values and inconsistent data. I used various Excel tools and techniques, such as trimming, filtering, and sorting, to clean the data and ensure its accuracy and consistency.

After cleaning the data, I used pivot tables to analyze and summarize the data and created a dashboard in Excel to visualize the data. The dashboard includes interactive charts that provide insights into the bike buyer data. Users can filter the data based on different criteria, enhancing their exploration and understanding.

#Conclusion:

This portfolio showcases my skills in data exploration, data cleaning, and data visualization using different tools and techniques. Please note that this is an ongoing project, and I intend to upload more projects related to Python, Power BI, Excel, and Tableau in the future. I will continue to update this portfolio with my latest work, so please check back periodically.
